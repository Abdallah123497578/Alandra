    <h1>Her Poem</h1>
    <p class="poem">
June 16th, 2025  
Written by Alandra Kristen Senanayake  
‚ÄúHim‚Äù  

The first day I saw him in that class  
I knew I was gonna enjoy class 24/7  
And I was right  

Me and him would target each other over any sport activity  
would laugh  
would be mad at the teacher  
would joke around  
would chase him  
Me and him grew into close friends  

But now  
Something has changed  
It‚Äôs the end of the year  

The thought of his name, stuck in my head 24/7  
Knowing I might never see him again  
I notice how amazing he is  
How good of a person he truly is  
How caring he is  
How childish he is  
How much he makes me laugh even if I‚Äôm in the mood  
But mostly how he knows how I am  
The thought of his name got me smiling too  

I didn‚Äôt need to tell him  
But he wrote me a poem  
He was the first to ever do that‚Ä¶  
He probably doesn‚Äôt know but I melted in happiness while reading it that I read it more than 10 times by now  

I told him one time ‚ÄúI like plushies‚Äù  
Showed him my plushies too  
Next time I saw him he had one for me, Ginny  

I was crying  
He tried to call me and was worried about me till I felt a bit better  

I would bike home  
He would walk or bike beside me till we separated our own ways  
I would pray that the clock wouldn‚Äôt run by fast but it did‚Ä¶  

I would yap  
He would listen to me yap  
I‚Äôm glad to have him in my life  

He would ask if I‚Äôm free  
Just to end up calling me or trying to meet up with me  
That made me smile  

I wouldn‚Äôt show I like him  
But he did  
He wasn‚Äôt that embarrassed to show it too  

I have strict parents  
He has them too but still tries to find a solution for there to be a us  

I have a brother  
He asked for permission  
And now he is trying to ask my dad  

You can already tell  
He deserves better than this and it's probably 100% true  
That he got me thinking about him, gotten me to write this too.  
He doesn‚Äôt know it but he knows a lot about me that nobody knows  
He is the reason I smile more often nowadays  
Hopefully this isn‚Äôt going to be a silent goodbye  
I pray that it isn‚Äôt  
I pray that I‚Äôll see him again üíñ
